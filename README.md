Rodrigo Celestino Queluz

This project was designed as part of the selection process for the company Tradeshift. 

The purpose of the code is to get the sides of a Triangule and determine the type 
of the Triangule (whether Isosceles, Scalene,Equilateral).

I used TDD (Test Driven Development) to start the development, because I think it is the best way to create and maintain
the quality of the code throughout the life cycle of the application.

In order to test and build the application, I decided to use Maven, for its simplicity in the use at the same
time its power in building and testing the application. Should a single test fail, Maven won't let the
application be built, making sure the code is always up to date with the tests.

For the application itself, I decided to make a single Java Application because I believe we should keep
things as simple as possible. I thought about making a Spring Web Application, with route
controller, but the requirements didn't needed to use a web application, and it seemed out of purpose
and could send the message that I will always look to impress, instead of quality code writing skills.
